# Description

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Port Scanning made easy>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

->OPORT finds and display all open ports on The IP or host name

->Uses Socket Module

->OPORT is a Port scanner made in Python, It is a Menu-driven scanner,
which provides multiple scanning options,

->Options include :-

1: Normal scan, note this process will be slow, as it'll find open ports from 1 to 65535

2: Specified scan, note this process requires the start port and end port for the scan

3: To check a single port, note this process requires a specified host

->OPORT gives the opportunity to see live scanning

## Core

## Running Tests

_->Let's see open ports at google.com_

_Note That you can use an IP address directly instead of Host name
As google.com is a website port 80 [http] and port 443 [https] will be open,
So We can do any of the 3 type of scans.

_->Let's do a Specified scan that is at 2_

For this we have to enter the start port and end port.
